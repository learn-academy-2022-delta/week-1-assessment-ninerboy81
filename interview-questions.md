# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a way to make sure that code is the same across the board. Version control. A way to make sure that everyone has the same exact code when needed. The difference between the two is that Github is a way for people to share code and receive code. 

  Researched answer: Git is a to manage source code. It is also a way to for multiple developers to change, update and download extensive code large amounts of code. GitHub is like icloud for apple photos. Able to be accessed anywhere and whenver by however many people. It manages Git.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: If i remember correctly if would be if, else if, and else to returna  true or false statement.

  Researched answer: &&, ||, | all would return a bootlean value due to the boolean value needing to be either true or false. Also it needs to be a boolean value so a number. 



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is what the computer is going to read when looking at numbers in an array starting with an index of 0. So 0,1,2,3 whereas value is the actual number for us to read and not the computer to read. So if there are four numbers then well read four where the computer would read 0-3. 

  Researched answer: I found a better way to explain it so an index is the values location within the array. 


4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: I believe that iterate means to give a placeholder in a sense to something in a string or an array. 

  Researched answer: Iteration is the process of repeating steps in a code until a certain results is given or met. Iteration is very close to a loop. 



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming is when two people are programming together. One is usually the driver where they have hands on the keyboard and typing and the other is the navigator where they are looking up code and answers and essentially telling the driver what to type of whats next. 

  Researched answer: After researching i found that the navigator actually looks forward into the code to help the driver but also reads each line of code after it is typed to help the driver. Also usually this is done on one workstation not two. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: This was very hard to understand but from my understanding is that a HOF is a way for a function to receive a function as an argument and output another function. 

2. Jest: Jest is a way to test code while its being written even parallel at the same time. 

3. Objects: Objects are apparently their own property? Where they have eveything they need on their own. 

4. Method: A method belongs to a function very much like a regular function except a function is not associated and cannot call on an objects but a method can. 

5. Classes: From my understandin is that classes help create the baseline for code and helps separate code.
